# <b>Lab7: Docker Compose</b>
- <b>`Compose`</b> is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- With <b>`Compose`</b>, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services.
- Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.
- <b>`Compose`</b> works in all environments: 
    - <b>production</b>
    - <b>staging</b>
    - <b>development</b>
    - <b>testing</b>, <b>as well as CI workflows</b>.


## Docker Compose Installation
- In [Lab1](https://github.com/TheSpiritMan/DevOps-Tools/tree/main/03%20Docker/Lab1%20-%20Docker%20Installation) of Docker, we have already installed `Docker` and `Docker-Compose`.
- To install `Docker-Compose` in <b>Ubuntu</b>:
    ```
    sudo apt install docker-compose -y
    ```
- If you want to install `Docker-Compose` in other Operating System, visit this [link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
