## Lab5 Vagrantfile

Here, we will try to make our Vagrantfile as minumum as possible using for-each loop.

In [Lab3](https://github.com/TheSpiritMan/DevOps-Practice/tree/main/01%20Vagrant/Lab3%20-%20MultipleVM), we can see that we have written same lines of code for multiple vm. 

### After making changes to Vagrantfile
We can see that the our Vagrantfile is now in less code and more efficient manner.
